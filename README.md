# Flight Booking System

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


Welcome to **My Flutter Project**! This README provides essential instructions for getting started, building, and running the project using Flutter commands.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (included with Flutter)
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio))
- Required environment variables set (e.g., `flutter/bin` added to your PATH)

## Commands Overview

### 1. Create a New Flutter Project

```bash
flutter create myproject
```
This command creates a new Flutter project named `myproject`. It generates the required folder structure and default files for your app.

#### Steps:
- Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
- Run the command above.
- Open the project in your preferred IDE.

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
flutter build
```
This command compiles your project into a format suitable for deployment. By default, it builds the release version.

#### Common Build Options:
- `flutter build apk` for Android APK files.
- `flutter build ios` for iOS builds.
- `flutter build web` for web applications.

### 3. Fetch Project Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```
This command resolves and fetches all the dependencies specified in your `pubspec.yaml` file. It ensures your project has the required packages to function.

#### Note:
- Run this command after modifying `pubspec.yaml`.
- It automatically updates the `.packages` and `.dart_tool` directories.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
flutter run
```
This command runs your Flutter application on a connected device, emulator, or web browser.

#### Steps:
- Ensure you have a device or emulator running.
- Run the command in your project directory.
- Use `flutter run -d <device-id>` to specify a particular device.
